# GYM_website_frontend
Frontend of a gym website has been created with the help of HTML and CSS.
Header Section:

The header section consists of three parts: left, middle, and right.
The left part contains the text "Fit Gym" and an image "logo.jpg."
The middle part contains an unordered list (navbar) with links for "Home," "About Us," "Fitness Center," and "Contact Us."
The right part contains two buttons, "Call Us Now" and "Email Us."
Container Section:

There's a container <div> with the class .container that contains a heading ("Join The best Gym") and a form.
The form has several text input fields (Name, Address, Email, Mobile number) and a "Submit Now" button.
CSS Styling Classes:

There are several CSS classes, such as .navbar, .btn, .formgroup, and .container, to style specific elements on the page.
The styles include properties for text color, background, padding, margins, borders, and more.
Form:

The form elements have placeholder attributes for user input.
